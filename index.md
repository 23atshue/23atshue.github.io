Hi! I‚Äôm Kat, from Lowell, MA. I‚Äôm a first-year student at MIT studying Urban Planning and Computer Science.

I founded [Science and Us](https://scienceandus.org), a nonprofit that runs events and creates online resources to help high schoolers learn how to make science clear and engaging.

I‚Äôm a founder of the [We Are America Project](https://weareamericaproject.com), working with 1300+ students in almost 25 states to share stories that spark conversations, led by the next generation, on what it means to be American.

Above all else, I value integrity, authenticity, empathy, and surrounding yourself with people who lift each other up.

Last summer, I interned at [Repl.it](https://repl.it), a Y Combinator-backed startup. During [high school](/hs), I organized [hackathons](https://mahacks.com), did [biology research](https://www.emerginginvestigators.org/articles/an-aqueous-solution-containing-soluble-substances-from-pvc-char-has-no-effect-on-the-rate-of-transformation-in-e-coli-cells), and earned [NCWIT's National Award](https://www.aspirations.org/blog/four-hundred-us-high-school-women-are-recognized-technological-achievements-0) for Aspirations in Computing.

I [fail](/fail) a lot.

When I'm not working on projects, I'm probably scrolling through memes or exercising‚Äîmaybe both.

## üì† Fun facts

- I use em dashes liberally
- My favorite foods are avocado and ravioli (ideally not together)
- I can do single-leg/pistol squats but am *very* far from being able to do single-arm push ups
- I use [Missive](https://missiveapp.com/) as my email client, Visual Studio Code as my primary text editor (but tumblr.com/customize will always have a special place in my heart), Google Calendar as my calendar, and scrap paper / vim + .txt files for todo lists
